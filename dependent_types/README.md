# Dependent Types Tutorials

These are only beginner level references (I put here what I find useful).

## Background Readings

+ Martin LÃ¶f's [Constructive Mathematics and Computer Programming](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/per-martin-lof/constructive-math.pdf) explains very well the rationale for dependent types, and is super super readable - it is awesome when reading stuff firsthand is feasible :)

## Practical Aspects of Coq

### Small

+ [Basic predicate logic](https://coq.inria.fr/tutorial/1-basic-predicate-calculus) - it's supposed to be outdated, but it worked great for me.
+ [Cornell Tactics Cheatsheet](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html)
+ Peirce is a very good speaker, and if you need to make a presentation or something on dependent types, [these slides](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/plmw12/Slides/plmw12-Pierce.pdf) use a good strategy you can copy. He introduces types as the most widely applied, automatic and robust formal method, and notes you have a trade-off between automation and expressive power (proof assistants > model checking > static analysis of types). That fits very well with 'Usable tools are used by everyone because you don't need to be an expert'.

### Books

+ [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) - The first volume is great to get started quickly and has a very
  pragmatic pacing (each chapter is short and has several exercises. Having a clear correspondence between expected work time and 'syntactic'
  chapter breaks is super useful for me).

## Using typed lambda calculi and related formalisms to represent program behavior

+ Types and Programming Languages (A very good and readable book, which unfortunately is still too much for my current amount of patience)
